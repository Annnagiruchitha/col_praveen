            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Corlmart, Inc. ("Corlmart," "we" or "us") may collect,
                 share, and use the information you provide to us, or we otherwise collect, when you use
                  any Corlmart website, application, or service, that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively,
                   the "Services"). We are responsible for providing the Services to you and are the controller
                    of personal data processed under this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Note that your use of the Services is also subject to the Corlmart Terms of Use ("Terms of Use"),
                 available at https://corlmart.com/terms. Please read this entire privacy policy and Terms of Use,
                  and confirm you understand and agree to them, before using the Services.</p>

            
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect information on and through our Services. The specific types of information we collect
             vary depending on the nature of our relationship with you and how you choose to interact with us but
              may include personal data. Generally, we collect information in three main ways: A) when you provide
               it to us, B) automatically when you use the Services, and C) from service providers and third parties.</p>

            <h2>A. Information You Provide</h2>
            <p>You can provide us with different kinds of information depending on how you interact with the
                Services. Sometimes we'll ask you to provide specific pieces of information, such as where we
                require it to provide parts of the Services to you (for example, by prompting you to complete
                an online registration process). If we ask you to provide us with information in these
                cases and you choose not to, you may not be able to access the relevant Services and/or
                some features may not operate as intended. For instance, to register as a user and create
                a profile, you'll need to provide us with basic registration information like your name,
                a public-facing display name, and password, country that you live in, and email address. 
                If you want to make a purchase or become a seller, we ask that you provide payment-related
                information (like your e-mail address, VAT number, and business location).</p>
            <p>We also collect the information you voluntarily provide as part of your user profile (like
                avatar, biography, skills, and interests), to sign up for email alerts, use social features
                and forums (likes, follows, comments, search queries), use our tools (including to create and 
                publish images and other content), complete surveys, or contact us for customer support. If you
                enter a contest or competitive event, we'll collect your application information and other
                information we may need to help confirm your eligibility and process rewards. We collect
                whatever information you choose to provide to us in those or other similar cases.</p>
            
            <h2>B. Information We Collect Automatically</h2>
            <p>We collect some information automatically when you visit, access, or use the Services.
            This includes information about your site or application usage, user interactions, purchases,
            and other activity in the Services, typically associated with your account profile or with
            an identifier we have assigned to your device or profile. While the specific types of
            information that we automatically collect may vary, they generally include:</p>

            <p>Usage information and statistics about how you interact with the Services, including 
            the application you used, saved preferences, crash reports, commenting data 
            (for spam prevention via Akismet), and navigation data (like the URLs of our websites
            that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page;</p>

            <p>Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access
            our Services, such as IP address, device identifiers, your internet service provider, plugins,
            or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and
            model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system-related 
            specifications); and</p>

            <p>The general location of your device, which we typically derive from your device's IP address.</p>

            <p>The Services use technologies such as cookies, log files, and web beacons to automatically
            collect the types of information listed above. Some of these technologies may create small
            files or record-keeping tools that may be stored on your device. They help us, our service
            providers, and third parties recognize your device and provide information about how you use
            and interact with the Services. For example, they support our ability to authenticate users,
            remember preferences, personalize experiences, and conduct data analytics. Please see the "Cookies" 
            section below of this Privacy Policy for further information about what information will be
            automatically collected when you visit our Services.</p>

            <p>Please note that if certain features on the Services are provided by third parties, those
            third parties may also use automated means of data collection and may record information
            about your use of the Services or others' websites over time. These features are subject 
            to those third parties' privacy notices and policies.</p>


            <h2>C. Information We Collect from Other Sources</h2>
            <p>In some cases, we may also receive information about you from third parties or service
            providers in connection with your use of the Services or your interactions with us on other
            platforms. For instance, while using the Services, individuals may provide information about
            another individual, or an authorized user (such as an account administrator) creating an 
            account on your behalf may provide information about you.</p>
            <p>As another example, if you choose to sign in to your Corlmart account with your account 
            on a third-party (like Facebook) website or service, or if you interact with Corlmart on
            an external website or service (like LinkedIn), the company that operates that website or 
            service may share some information with us in accordance with their own privacy practices.
            Your privacy settings on the other company's website or service typically control the specific
            types of information they can share with us, so please be sure to review and update them
            regularly.</p>

                <h2>Basis for Processing</h2>
                <p>The legal bases we rely on to process your personal data depend on the Services you use and how you
                interact with them. They primarily include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contractual Necessity: we process personal data to perform the Services you requested under our Terms of Service
                    or other similar contractual agreements with you. For example, we process personal data to set up and maintain your
                    account; process your purchases; provide user-experience features (like saving likes and follows); monitor and analyze 
                    the Services; and detect and prevent fraud or other similar misuse. We also rely on the performance of a contract to manage

                    changes to our applicable terms or policies.</li>
                    <li>Legitimate Interests: we process personal data as needed for Corlmart's business purposes, as balanced against the 
                    potential impact on your privacy rights. This includes many common purposes that you'd reasonably expect, such as to: 
                    communicate with you, respond to your requests, or provide you with account updates, upgrades, and information; 
                    better understand our users and their preferences; personalize your experience, save your preferences, authenticate our 
                    users, and provide similar user experience features; develop, deliver, and improve the Services and other offerings

                    promotional offers; secure and protect the Services; prevent fraud and illegal activity; and support internal 
                    purposes such as auditing and data analysis.</li>
                    <li>Legal Obligations: we process personal data when necessary to comply with legal obligations, such as 
                    responding to legitimate requests from law enforcement authorities or other government officials in accordance 
                    with relevant legal processes.</li>
                    <li>Consent: we process personal data when you provide us with your consent to do so. You aren't required 
                    to provide consent if you do not want your personal data to be processed for the requested purposes, and you 
                    may withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
                    <li>Retention</li>
                    <li>We retain personal data for as long as we reasonably need it to fulfill the purposes for which it was 
                    collected. For example, if you create an account with us, we will store the personal data associated with 
                    your account for as long as needed to maintain your account, provide the Services you requested, enforce any 
                    applicable terms that govern your use of the Services, and maintain appropriate records to reflect our 
                    delivery of the Services to you.</li>
